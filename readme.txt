The zip file contains the files used to perform numerical simulation
and bifurcation studies of large networks of two-dimensional integrate
and fire neurons and of the corresponding mean field models derived in
our paper:

Nicola W, Campbell SA (2013) Bifurcations of large networks of
two-dimensional integrate and fire neurons. J Comput Neurosci

The neural models used are the Izhikevich model and the Adaptive
Exponential model. The files are organized into three folders, one
corresponding to each of the numerical examples in the paper. Each
numerical example folder consists of MATLAB code and MATCONT code. The
MATLAB code contains a series of GUI's to implement direct simulations
of the network and of the corresponding mean field model. The MATCONT
code generates the bifurcation diagrams of the mean field model. The
MATCONT code should be extracted out of the folder and placed in the
root MATCONT folder. The MATLAB files may be placed in any folder, but
all files for a particular numerical example should be placed in the
same folder.
